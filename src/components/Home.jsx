							I had wanted to dive into React for awhile and decided that the best way to do it would be to come up with a project. I had built a portfolio site a few years back using mostly jQuery and decided that it made sense to try to rebuild it in React. Beyond showing screenshots of past projects, I'll be using this to try to do different things using React.<br/><br/>
							I am a 37-year old web developer who currently resides in the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago. Over the years I've had the good fortune of working in a number of different industries and meet some incredible people. I've spent over 10 years as a Front End Web Developer. I'm proficient with html, css, javascript and jQuery. I've also worked with a number of different databases including: Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Ingres, and MySQL. Over the past 5 years I've worked on a number of ecommerce related projects using ecommerce platforms such as: Magento, WooCommerce, Shopify, and XCart. When I'm not working, I enjoy running. I've ran 2 marathons and 6 half marathons. I've also been running the Edison Park Turkey Trot for 16 years. I also enjoy watching sports and spending time with my family.
